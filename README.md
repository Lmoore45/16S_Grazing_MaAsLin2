# Grazing Microbiome Analysis with MaAsLin2

## Overview
This repository contains R scripts and resources for analyzing 16S rRNA gene sequencing data to compare microbial communities under different grazing practices. Specifically, the analysis focuses on distinguishing between conventional and adaptive grazing practices using MaAsLin2, a tool for multivariable association analysis in microbiome studies.

## Why MaAsLin2?
MaAsLin2 is pivotal in microbiome research as it allows for the integration of microbial data with metadata to identify statistically significant associations between microbial taxa and environmental or experimental conditions. This approach is particularly useful in agricultural studies, such as comparing grazing treatments, to understand how management practices influence microbial community structures.

## Data Structuring
Correct data structuring is crucial for successful analysis in MaAsLin2. This involves organizing the abundance data and corresponding metadata correctly:

- **Abundance Data**: Should be structured with microbial taxa as columns and samples as rows. Each cell contains the abundance of a taxon in a sample.
- **Metadata**: Should align with the abundance data, containing information about each sample, such as grazing practice, which serves as a variable for comparison.

## Repository Content
The scripts in this repository are designed to be straightforward and reproducible, starting from raw count data to the final statistical analysis and visualization:

- `Data_Processing.R`: Script to process and tidy raw 16S count data.
- `MaAsLin_Analysis.R`: Script to run MaAsLin2 with structured data, including adjusting parameters specific to 16S data.
- `Results_Visualization.R`: Code for visualizing significant associations found by MaAsLin2.

Each script contains comments explaining each step to ensure clarity and ease of use.

## Getting Started
To use this repository:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have R installed along with the required libraries (`Maaslin2`, `tidyverse`, `readr`, `readxl`).
3. Set your working directory and adjust paths in the scripts as necessary based on your local environment.
4. Run the scripts in sequence: Data processing -> MaAsLin2 Analysis -> Visualization.

## Contributing
Contributions to improve the analysis or extend the scripts are welcome. Please fork the repository and submit pull requests with your enhancements.
